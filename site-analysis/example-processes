Capitalizations and spaces in system names.
  1. Query all files, folders, and pages
  2. In those pages search all system names for " " to find spaces.
  3. To find capitalizations, create a variable that's the system name lowercased. If the lowercased version doesn't match the original version, then there's capitalizations.
  4. For any error, add asset to report.

Wrong Metadata set
Our metadata is associated with asset type. Block=Block, File=Default, Folder=Folder, Page=Page or Page RWD
  1. Query all blocks, files, folders, pages, and symlinks using MetadataSet
  2. For each asset, if $result.identifer.Type != the queried MetadataSet
  3. add to report.

Find Large Images
  1. Query all images
  2. If the file is an image (contains ".jpg" or ".png" or ".gif") and $result.fileSize > 130000 (130K)
  3. add to report.

Index not Listed First
  1. Query all folders
  2. Exclude folders that begin with an underscore $result.path.indexOf("_")
  3. If the folder does not contain files or images $result.path.contains("images")
  4. Get the children of the folder, and then sort by "folderOrder" #set($sortedChildren = $_SortTool.sort($children, "folderOrder"))
  5. Run a "foreach" and if the first counted is not named "index" ($foreach.count == 1 && !$sortResult.name.contains("index"))
  5. add to report.

Pages not published
  1. Query all pages
  2. Turn dates into numbers ($_MathTool.toNumber( $result.LastPublishedOn ))
  3. If LastPublishedOn <= lastModified
  4. add to report

Non-breaking spaces
  1. Query all pages
  2. Grab appropriate Structured Data Nodes ($result.getStructuredDataNode("main-content-content").getTextValue())
  3. Serialize that content ($_SerializerTool.serialize($mainContent,true) ))
  4. If non-breaking spaces exist (.contains("#160")
  5. add to report.

Divs in WYSIWYGs
  Like above but if there's a ending div tag (.contains("</div>") then add to report.
  
Links go to Testing server
  Like above but if a link url contains start of testing server (.contains("http://web.upstate.edu")), add to report
  Can also be used to find links that go to Cascade itself.

Find specific text
  Like above, as long as $whatReport contains "textSearch", it searches for a text
  If search string is in the summary of the currentPage, it uses: $currentPage.metadata.getSummary()
  If search string is in the title of the page/$whatReport then: $whatReport.replaceAll("textSearch_","")

External Symlinks that could be Internal Links
  1. Query all symLinks
  2. If link contains links that would appear internally
  3. add to report.

Plans for future additions
  1. search for comments in wysiwyg
  2. find blocks and files that have no relationships
  3. find assets missing metadatasets (query vs. tree traversal)

Show the Report
  1. At the beginning we initialized an array, that will become a multidemensional array.
  2. When there is an error found, code adds an array of values into a multidimensional array.
      id -  $result.getIdentifer().getId() eg. "dbe9cf5a8b7f08ee4b34b5a8751a7e86"
      path - $showSiteName + $result.path eg: "site://site-analysis/documentation/index"
      asset type - $result.identifer.Type eg: "page"
  4. When it's ready to produce the report, it checks to see if the array is empty. If not:
  5. Shows title of error report and description.
  6. Velocity #foreach through the array and spits out a list of errors and links to Cascade.
  7. Spit out a fake array to use in Web Services $ids = [#foreach ( $item in $notPublishedReport )"$item.id", #end ]
  
Splitting ModifiedX
  1. If $whatSite.contains("modified")
  2. get the days by: $whatSite.replaceAll("modified","")
  3. Query assets
  4. Run foreach for an queried asset array
  5. Only process assets modified in the last X days

Splitting CreatedX
  above but replace "modified" with "created"
  5. Only proceess assets created in the last X days:
    $_DateTool.difference($chanwCallJavaMethod,$systemDate).getDays() <= $dayInteger
